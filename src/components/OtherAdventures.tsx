        In addition to coding and technology, I have dedicated an extraordinary
        amount of energy to technical mountain climbing, and I thoroughly enjoy
        scaling enormous peaks üèîÔ∏è.

        When I&#39;m not coding or conquering mountains, I&#39;m exploring the
        world and immersing myself in new cultures. I&#39;ve set foot in over 35
        countries and spent a significant amount of time soaking up the vibes of
        Asia and Latin America.

        But let&#39;s get real - nothing beats a delicious cup of coffee
        (aeropress is my go-to) and some scrumptious food. It&#39;s the simple
        pleasures in life that really get me going!
